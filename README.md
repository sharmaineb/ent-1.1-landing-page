### Landing Page Instructions
1. **Choose Your Product**: Select a product for which you want to create the landing page. It could be a new product concept you're interested in exploring or a previous portfolio project you want to showcase.
   
2. **Incorporate Persuasion Principles**: Try to incorporate each of Robert Cialdini’s six principles of persuasion (Reciprocity, Commitment, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity) into your landing page design and content.
   
3. **Build the Landing Page**: Develop the landing page using HTML, CSS, and any necessary JavaScript or frameworks. Ensure that the page effectively communicates the value proposition of your product and includes a call-to-action prompting users to sign up or express interest.
   
4. **User Testing**: Test the landing page with at least 5 qualified potential users. Gather feedback on their impressions, what aspects of the page resonated with them, and any suggestions for improvement.
   
5. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Take note of the feedback received during user testing and make necessary iterations to the landing page. Focus on addressing any pain points or areas of confusion identified by users.
   
6. **Relaunch and Test Again**: Once you've made the necessary adjustments, relaunch the landing page and conduct further testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the changes.
